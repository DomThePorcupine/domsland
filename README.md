# The source code that powers my personal website!

## Some interesting things:
1.  There is a Dockerfile here, the reason for this is I have a single digital ocean
    node running many different things. They are all routed through nginx as a reverse
    proxy, so having this work like any other service is more convient for me.

2.  I'm using [bulma](https://bulma.io) as my css framework. It looks nice and i've used
    in it some of my other projects in place of materialize because it is a little lighter.
    I sincerely cannot reccomend it enough!
