    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      Well it's that time of undergrad, after 4 long years I'm finally here. Graduation 
      is looming just a few short months away. My mind is racing. Where will I work? 
      Do I start applying now? Should I apply for internships? Am I going back to grad 
      school? Where am I going to be living? <i>Enough!</i> I say internally. I eventually r
      eason that throwing my resume out there can't 
      be a bad thing, worst case scenario I get an interview somewhere! Thus my predicament 
      is born. I haven't had an interview in months, and my most rigorous algorithm/data 
      structure's course was... wow... going on 2 years now. It's been a while Farnan. I
      decide the best way to approch things would be to use hackerrank to brush up on my
      CS thinking skills. Away we go!
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The challenge, as with almost all of them, seemed simple at first. We are given a 
      set of 4 valid characters, a list of 'valid' 8 character sequences, and a start and 
      end 8 character sequence. Then a 'move' is defined. Taken an 8 char sequence,
      and change a single char in it to create another one. The challenge is to find
      the minimum number of moves to get from the start sequence to the end sequence
      using only sequences in the 'valid' list.
      <div>
        <strong>List of chars:</strong><br/><pre>['H', 'I', 'Y', 'A']</pre>
        <br/>
        <strong>List of valid sequences:</strong><br/>
        <pre>HHHHHHHH<br/>HIHHHHHH<br/>HIYHHHHH<br/>HIYHHHAH<br/>HHHHHHHA<br/>HIYAHHHH</pre>
        <strong>Start, End:</strong><br/>
        <pre>HHHHHHHH, HIYAHHHH</pre>
      </div>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Start Thinking!</h3>
    <p>
      So right away a few words and concepts tip me off to something... 'minimum moves' sounds a lot
      like 'minimum hops'. Getting from one value to another through a predefined set of
      values sounds like graph traversal. So perhaps something with graphs, but what's the relation?
      As you probably know a graph - at least in our context - is composed of a set of nodes, 
      and a set of edges that connect them (if you are new to graph's and graph theory I suggest Trudeau's amazing book
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486678709">
      <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i></a>).
      We can thus think of a sequence <code>HHHHHHHH</code> as a node in our graph. Continuing
      the thought we can then think of an edge as a representation of a one character differnce between nodes!
      This means that <code>HHHHHHHH</code> has an edge connecting it to <code>HIHHHHHH</code>, but
      not to <code>HIYHHHHH</code>.
      AH HA! Maybe we've cracked it!
      <br/><br/>
      <img src="../imgs/example.png">
      <br/><br>
      Okay so maybe that's not the prettiest diagram, but I think it gets the idea across!
      We can see the way we could represent the the given values in a graph! And also that
      the minimum number of hops is 3.
    </p>

    <h3>Start Hacking!</h3>
    <p>
      Now the fun begins! For this particular challenge I saw that java was available and opted for
      that, in the back of my mind I had a feeling preformance would be an issue and it was! Let's
      begin, of course with the hacky stuff. I'll talk about it, why it's bad, and how it lead me
      to a better solution. Step one: nodes are easy! We are given an array of strings! So let's
      think about the edges, we need a way to tell if two <code>String</code>s are exactly 1 char
      different. This is how we will know if they are 'neighbors' in our graph. I'm in a time crunch so I'm
      thinking maybe I can get away with a not so great solution, but I also know to verify that
      there is only 1 char different I must compare N chars (where N is the length of the strings) <code>O(N)</code>. Not great - 
      but there's only 8 chars to a string, and sometimes it will fail before the end. So I'm thinking
      it will be practically faster than <code>O(N)</code> would suggest. Here's my original block of code:<br>
      <img src="../imgs/onediff.png">
      <br>It is <i>very</i> simple, but it works and I am happy. The next step is to represent the graph
      in code somehow. Typically this is done with a class, but I have something different in mind.
      We know how many nodes we have, and so why not use a HashMap? No resizing needs to be done,
      because we can allocate at the beginning. Then looking up a nodes neighbors is an <code>O(1)</code>
      operation!<br>
      <img src="../imgs/graph.png">
      <br>As you can see I also opted to represent the neighbors with a linked list. I did this because
      we don't care about the order of the neighbor nodes, but we <i>do</i> need to add a lot of them.
      Since add is our main operation, we choose a data structure with <code>O(1)</code> insertion time!
      <br><br>
      Things seem to be coming along nicely! All the time complexity stuff and <code>Big-O</code> is 
      coming back to me. I check the clock and see that I'm doing not great on time,
      but hey I'm out of practice. I take a break and stretch my legs before sitting back down to write
      the bad code.
      <br><br>
      Bad code? What?<br>Instead of explaining right away why don't I just show you:<br>
      <img src="../imgs/badcode.png"><br>
      And I combined it with this:<br>
      <img src="../imgs/morebad.png">
      <br><br>
      Ah yes, our good friend <code>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</code>. At this point it is the most <i>obvious</i>
      solution. I know it's bad but I ignore that and keep working, maybe I'll get lucky and the test
      cases won't stress my implementation that much. I should have known better.
      <br><br>
      My next action really shows my rust. I implemented dikjstra's to find the path between start and
      end. Someone astute might note that in this case (where the weights of all the edges are the same)
      Dikjstra's is actually doing the same thing as BFS in a slightly different way. This means we don't
      really gain anything, and I was already forgetting exactly how I wrote dikjstra's all those years
      in Pitt's CS 1501 with Farnan. So once I figured that out I hacked together a working version of
      the BFS algorithm. It was at this time that everything came together for the first time, and I started
      getting correct answers! Exciting stuff. Time to pass it off into hackerrank and see how I do against
      their test cases. At this point time wise I was hoping to be done and move on to another challenge,
      hackerrank had other plans. I passed the first two examples and none of the remaining 4. By adding
      a check to see if the end was even a valid sequence and making sure that start was included in the 
      list of valid sequences I was able to knock off 2 more. Now I'm 4/6. I'm not passing but I'm better
      than 50%.
      <br><br>
      So what's the problem? Hackerrank is telling me I have a timeout... great I might actually have to
      think about this some more. Time to <i>really</i> test my code. I am already reading from a file
      to get my input, so lets throw together a python script to create example valid lists:<br>
      <img src="../imgs/pygen.png">
      <br><br>
      After adding this I also added in two debug statements, one when i started generating neighbors, and
      one when I started actually preforming the BFS. It became apparent almost immediately that my code
      was taking the majority of the time trying to populate the neighbor lists rather than running BFS.
      <hr>
      <h3>More Thinking... ðŸ¤”</h3>
      Clearly a problem is that I have to iterate over the entire list of valid sequences every time I
      want to find a new neighbor. So how can we mitigate this? My phone buzzes and I respond to my
      friend's text message. I think back to a cool project where I implemented a DLB trie to use as
      an 'autocorrect', a user types in a string and we search the DLB for strings that are similar.
      Specifically with the same prefix. So now I'm thinking, maybe we can shove the list into a DLB,
      there's lots of repeated letters so space shouldn't be an issue. At this point I also have no
      clear idea <i>how</i> this will work at all. Since I know the for letters I could always substitute
      each one for each location in the sequence that I am looking for neighbors for. This is a bad
      solution though, because it will require string operations. And string operations are
      <i>unbelievably</i> slow in java. I want to avoid them at all costs. So I'm thinking in the trie's
      search function i can do some magic. If I would have tried that's exactly what it would have been.
      Magic.
      <br><br>
      My head hurts, this seems like a good solution but it just doesn't quite fit. It works great if I
      want a list of all the sequences with a different last letter, because of course the prefix is the
      same. If only there was a way to change the prefix.
      <br><br>
      My first aha moment, my friend is mid sentence with me. Telling me something important about an
      upcoming flight. I cut her off <i>"What if I reverse it!"</i> I exclaim! She is confused, and I
      apoligise, but we've all been there when we finally see the problem in the right light. I get my
      code high-five (which is the way my non-computer science friends acknowledge that something
      awesome happend) and immediately start drawing out tries.
      <br><br>
      At first I thoguht only about reversing the sequence I was looking for. I thoguht about this because
      I was trying to figure out how I would check the very first character for different neighbors.
      After some time I realized that I could generalize things.
      Here was my breakthrough:<br><strong>Let's store 8 diffrent roots in our trie structure. Each will have an
        offset according to it's position in the array. This shifts index of the letter we want to check
        to the end of each trie. We can then continue down until there are no more nodes 'right' and we
        have a list of all neighbors, without looking trough the whole list of valid nodes. In fact we only
        have to search through 8, and because of the properites of a trie this is very efficient. Oh, and 
        still no string operations required.
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      Here is a diagram to explain what is going on. For simplicity I have limited my string length to 4 instead
      of 8. We are also using <code>['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']</code> as our set of valid chars, in an attempt to be
      less confusing. In the diagram we have added two strings to the DLB, <code>ABCD, AACD</code>. We can see
      that changing the B to an A makes them the same, thus they are neighbors, but we needed an offset of 2 to
      create the prefix <code>CDA</code> such that knowing they were neighbors was easy!<br><br>
      <img src="../imgs/dlb.png">
      <br><br>
      Whew! That was a lot! I probably lost you there, but if you made it. Thanks I appreciate it! Now for
      the fun part again, writing code!
      <br>Without further delay here are the two functions:<br>
      <img src="../imgs/add.png">
      <br><br>and<br>
      <img src="../imgs/search.png">
      <br><br>
      Because I was already using a linked list, I could just replace the neighbors function with the search
      function. After testing a few more time on my local machine it was clear that this did not take nearly
      as long. Time to submit to Hackerrank again... I pasted the code in, clicked run... and watched all the
      check marks turn green. It was truly a great feeling. I have no idea if it the best solution, or what
      is, but it was a great excersize for my brain to try to put all these concepts I learned about together
      in one big project. Oh well, on to the next!
      <br><br>
      That's all folks! Thanks for reading :)
