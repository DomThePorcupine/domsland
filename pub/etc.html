        My Blog
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I write blog posts every once in a while. Sometimes they are about code. Other
        times they are about my other passion projects such as wine! It is a place for
        me to document the cool things I do, and try to improve on my writing.

        I recently got my hands on a 
        <i><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1311247-REG/fujifilm_16542359_x_t20_camera_silver.html">Fujifilm X-T20</a></i>
        camera as per the reccomendation of roommate. I started out with 0 knowledge of cameras. ISO, aperture, shutterspeed? No idea 
        what their functions were or how I should use them. So i signed up for a photography course at the uni I would be studying 
        at in Australia! This is the result of that class and some photos I like that I have taken!

        Movies
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        I really like movies! I'll be the first to admit that I am lacking in terms of cinema. I'm not someone who's
        watched a ton of indie movies, or someone who can rattle off a long list of foreign films. That said I <i>want</i>
        to expand my view and watch more movies in the future, and I've seen many obscure films. Because my friends and
        I try to get together about once a week for movie night, I decided to start writing about them. Just some general
        thoughts, not really reviews as I'm not a critic but just enough for me to enjoy myself!
